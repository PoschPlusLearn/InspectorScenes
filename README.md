# InspectorScenes
Inspector Scenes is a custom PropertyDrawer for Unity that allows anyone to use a SceneAsset in the inspector. 
You are able to access the index, name or path of that asset and use it when loading any scene you like! 

Right now this is a work in progress!

Use this code however you would like! 
Note: 
Some of the code includes Unity’s UI Toolkit (UITK) functionality and code just keep this in minde when using.

If you do use this code and would like to add credits it would be greatly appreciated! 
You can use "PoschPlus (Allen)" for credits! 

If you have any issue's or would like to contribute just email me.
Email: poschplusdev@gmail.com

I would like to eventually, setup an easy way to manage this on the github but 
for now just send me a message and let me know your thought's or bugs, issues you run accrost!

Thank you for checking this out or useing my code!
